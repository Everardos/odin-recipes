        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a recipe my grandma used to make, which she had gotten from her neighbor, who was a chef. I loved it so much as a child that I would not stop pestering her to give me the recipe until she relented.</p>
        <p>As an aside, this cake fares quite well when shipped next-day air, and even when shipped internationally via express service. When I was living away from home, and even a few times when I lived abroad, my mother would make this cake for my birthday, cover it in saran wrap, and have it shipped to me, only leaving off the chocolate syrup to prevent it from making a mess.</p>
